## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### **Reasons why I love CS193**
- It's student run
- It's a CS class
- It makes me feel less bad for having classes from 10:30am to 6:20pm on the day I have CS193

**Bold works just like Discord, that's cool**
*ITALICIZE WORKS TOO*

~~I haven't used like, half these characters ever and I have to look for them~~
_~~Does combining stuff work?~~_

>why do quotes use a greater than sign like what????

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
